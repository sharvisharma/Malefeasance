                    <b>Precautions:</b> While recharging your mobile prepaid card account you have to give your mobile number to the vendor. Though ideally one should go to the Customer Care Centre of the Mobile Service Provider to get the recharge done but as a matter of convenience people approach a local vendor who keeps prepaid vouchers of practically all the mobile service providers and of all denominations. Thereby for recharging they end up giving their cell numbers and hence the scope of misuse. It is advisable to get the recharge done online or through the Customer Care Centre or one should take the voucher and key in the digits by themselves or ask some trusted person to do it for them. Purchasing sim cards from local vendors also warrants you to give your id proofs and photos which could possibly be duplicated and misused. Then again, the convenience of getting a recharge done on credit, if the local vendor is known to you, is also an attractive deal. Use now Pay later may cost you greater.

                    Precautions: A skimmer is a device which is used for copying the data on the card on to that device which can be retrieved later and the data thereafter is implanted or embedded on a blank card thus a clone (duplicate) copy of a card is ready for use. While using an ATM kiosk, look out for suspicious fittings on the machine itself. Skimmer comes in different sizes and shapes which are hard to identify and locate. They are fitted precisely at a place where you insert your debit/credit cards into the machines so that they can capture the data residing on the card. Look out for those protruding or extra layer of fittings by physically checking and actually pulling the exact slot where you insert the card. Sounds inhuman but needs to be done. Then again to record the pin number that you are going to type on the keypad after insertion of your card, small cameras are fitted in obscure or concealed places so that they can clearly record your key strokes. Thus, your card data and your pin number are now with the fraudster and a cloned card is ready for use. Pin numbers can be recorded by also placing pin overlay pads (an extra layer of pin pad which is the replica of original pin pad and is attached to the original pin pad) which in actual would be a keylogger that would log the keystrokes. Therefore, also check the pin pad of that machine. Always cover the pin pad with your hand while keying in the pin number for extra safety. Yet another way would be to send a phishing mail, collect card information from unsuspecting victims, collecting CVV number by use of Social Engineering and make a clone card. Pin number and OTP is collected later while using the cloned card. Thus, look out for suspicious mails and never click on the links appearing in an email. Never share your card details, CVV number and OTP with anyone. Learn more about the modus operandi of Social Engineering.

                    Precautions: Keyloggers may in the form of a hardware that could be attached to your computer system or to an ATM Machine actual key pad, or it could be a software that could be implanted into your computer system. Difficult to trace them out because generally they are in stealth mode and even best of antivirus used by your systems may not be able to block them. A cyber security expert or a malware analyst’s would be able to find out its presence upon thorough investigation of the system. Keep your antivirus updated, update your operating system to latest versions through timely patches released by the providers, use licensed software’s, do not click on suspicious links and the links that originate from unknown source, do not download free songs, movies, videos, software’s, applications, games etc., for a keylogger could be embedded in them and you may end up downloading one for free. Make sure to enable Two Factor Authentication for an additional layer of security, use virtual keyboard to enter the username and password and install a good antivirus on your system to stay cyber safe.

                    Precautions: No proper solution for this because a hacker may clone your sim and use your cell number to send SMS’s. There are websites, software’s and apps that allow a fraudster to send spoofed SMS’s to cheat, deceive or defame someone. A Remote Access Trojan if implanted into your cell phone can allow the implanter to send SMS’s using your device. Furthermore, such spoofed SMS’s are difficult to trace and track. Anonymity is greater when a fraudster uses techniques to spoof.

                    Precautions: No proper solution for this because a hacker may clone your sim and use your cell number to make calls. They may also use VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) for spoofing. There are websites, software’s and apps that allow a fraudster to make spoofed calls to cheat, deceive or defame someone and they also have the facility to change the modulation, depth, pitch, decibel and quality of voice, a male’s voice can be changed to a female’s voice or to a voice of a kid and vice a versa. A Remote Access Trojan if implanted into your cell phone can allow the implanter to make calls using your device. Furthermore, VOIP calls are difficult to trace and track and thus anonymity is at its peak in such spoofed calls. To stay protected, Don’t place all your trust in the caller ID information presented to you. Now that you know that Caller ID can be easily spoofed by the use of third-party caller ID spoofing services and other tools, that you won’t be trusting the technology as you have been in the past. This should help you in the quest to scam-proof your brain.

                      Precautions: Do not click on links that appear from unknown sources. Do not trust the friends you have made on social networking sites. A few cases were reported wherein the so-called friends on social networking sites, sent provocative and/or suggestive pictures embedded with malwares that affected the computer systems and the unsuspected victims clicked on the picture and downloaded malware and got affected in the process. Since different algorithms are used to create ransomwares, the encryption level also changes and hence there is no tailor-made approach to these crimes. Various breeds of ransomware are on prowl but ideally the aim of the hacker would be to deny access to your own computer/network or data. One fit suit all, does not work here as a solution. Remember to take real-time backups. Updating the information and cyber security policies and practices should be an ongoing and proactive endeavour. Patch management has to be in real time right from firewalls, antivirus, intrusion detection alarms etc., and should be upgraded timely. Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) has to be carried out periodically. In the year 2017, WannaCry ransomware affected approximately 150 countries at one go.

                    Precaution: Cyberstalking is a serious crime, and no one wants to become a victim. One way to help protect yourself is to keep your personal information private on the internet. That’s a start. Be careful about allowing physical access to your computer and other web-enabled devices like smartphones. Cyberstalkers can use software and hardware devices (sometimes attached to the back of your PC without you even knowing it) to monitor their victims. Be sure you always log out of your computer programs when you step away from the computer and use a screensaver with a password. Delete or make private any online calendars or itineraries — even on your social network — where you list events you plan to attend. That information could allow a cyberstalker to know where and when you’re planning to be somewhere. A lot of personal information is often displayed on social networks, such as your name, date of birth, where you work, and where you live. Use the privacy settings in all your online accounts to limit your online sharing with those outside your trusted circle. You can use these settings to opt out of having your profile appear when someone searches for your name. You can block people from seeing your posts and photos, too. If you post photos online via social networks or other methods, be sure to turn off the location services metadata in the photo. The metadata reveals a lot of information about the photo — where and when it was taken, what device it was taken on, and other private information. Most often, metadata comes from photos taken on a mobile phone. You can turn this off — it’s usually a feature called geo-tagging — in your phone’s settings.

                    Precautions: Morphing has become a child’s play with tools, apps, software’s and technology made available by the internet for free. Various apps allow photo editing and high-end software’s allows the act of morphing very easy. High end filters are available for free which can be used to enhance the quality of the pictures. With Drag and Drop and Cut, Copy and Paste options, super imposing or replacing the body and/ or body parts of one individual with that of another can be done with considerable ease. Thus, porn and obscene contents are easily created to defame someone by using the victims face and other identification features that are similar to the victims and a lookalike picture of the victims can be uploaded online thereby shaming them. Do not share your pictures with unknown people or strangers and while uploading on social networking sites like Fb, Instagram, Snapchat etc, one should have an appropriate privacy setting in place before sharing. Very recently a girl committed suicide when she learnt that a morphed vulgar pictures of her were circulated online by an accused. Care before you Share.

                    Precaution: Identity theft is the prime motive of Hackers especially when they would want to defame or cheat a woman. Once unauthorized access is gained to a women’s social networking sites account, these hackers would invite her friends to like stuffs that are prohibited or filthy in nature. Vulgar, obscene and morphed pictures are posted and people start commenting on them. Messages that invite people for having good time are posted so as to defame that women because her own friends and the new one which the hacker adds from his side would think that this woman herself is posting messages and photos on her own account and hence these would be factual. Hence never click on unknown links, social networking sites password should be strong and needs to be changed often. Your social networking sites are linked to an email account so the password of that mail account should never be revealed to anyone and if you suspect it to be compromised, you need to change the password immediately. Always log out from all the accounts you have logged in. For apps on your mobile, it is advisable to have them password protected as an extra layer of security. Do not reveal your passwords to best of your friends because you never know when they would turn out to be your foe.

                    Precautions: Very recently it was reported that fake versions of online games (including Temple Run, Free Flow and Hill Climb Race) that are popular and have huge number of downloads were uploaded on play stores as free downloads. Innocent people not able to distinguish between the real and the fake versions, downloaded the fake version and ended up in sharing entire personal data that resided on their devices. The hacker can also infect the devices with malwares and thereby causing financial losses and also commit identity theft. Addiction to play online games is again a drawback and cases where young children using their parents credit/debit cards without their consent or knowledge to play online games have been reported. Children use their parents high end mobile phones to play such games. The OTP that is sent by the bankers are received by these children and the parents come to know only when they get the card account statement. Many parents do not see the details of the statements and pays up the amount online thereby giving their children a good cover for their forbidden acts. A few games were allegedly displaying inappropriate pictures that could cloud the innocent minds of children. Parents need to keep a tab on what their children are downloading or playing online by examining their browsing history and it is a point to worry if the browsing history is cleared regularly by children because that means they are hiding their footprints. Parental controls should come into play.

                    Precautions: With the advent of high-end printers/copiers and scanners, it is far easier to forge logos, water marks, letter heads, signatures, companies’ seals, governments seals etc., and entire set off documents to cheat innocent victims. They are made to believe that they are being offered a high pay package by way of salary either in their own country or somewhere in the western world for which the victims are asked to deposit money on various pretext to get that job call letter. Even telephonic interviews are facilitated to make the victims believe that they are interacting with right entities. Money maybe asked as security deposit, visa facilitation charges, RBI clearance, insurance for travel, opening of bank accounts abroad, for facilitating staying facilities, federal charges etc., Fake and forged documents duly signed under seal are reduced on the forged letterheads of the companies are sent to the victims to trick them into believing that the offer that they have is for real. Check and recheck before paying anything against such job calls. Do your research, find out more about the company, lookup for its website, call if necessary and ask them if they have floated such requirements in actual. Never pay upfront.

                    Precautions: Since the advent of high-end filters, photo editors, printers, scanners, apps and software’s, creation of any form of content is a child’s play. With a little knowledge of technology and the requisite tools that are available for free on internet, one can do wonders using their imagination in the virtual world. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has just added speed, sharpness, ease, convenience, cost effectiveness in the sphere of creation of contents. Superimposing of images and mixing them with high-end filters, makes it extremely difficult for anyone to distinguish the original from the copy (fake). Before trusting any content, be it audio clips, video clips, photos, songs, documents, movies etc, one should verify the source from where it originated. The file sizes of the fakes differ from that of the original ones and that needs to be verified. Metadata (data’s data) if available of both the contents may reveal the facts. Forensic examination may also reveal the facts of the contents. Ideally speaking, it becomes almost impossible to distinguish the original content from the fakes.

                    Precautions: Before creating an account on dating sites one should keep in mind about frauds being played by the sites and its users. Be careful before swiping Left or Right because your act may swipe you outright and you may have not much left before you could ever realize your mistake. Fake profiles are uploaded on such sites, false information is provided and old pictures are uploaded by the users to lure the victims. A male may think that he is dating online with a beautiful female but chances are high that the beautiful female may turn out to be an awful male in real. It could be a visa versa case as well. Cases have been reported wherein males were asked to undress and post their pictures on the site and later those pictures were used to extort money to get them deleted from the site by the accused or were threatened that they would publish them online. Often it has been reported that the reality is far from real as against that which has been mentioned in the profile and the pictures also do not confirm or match or resemble to the ones uploaded. Personal information is gathered by these sites while registering people as clients with them and may be used to one’s disadvantage. In a particular case, a dating website was hacked into and the hacker threatened to make all the names of the clients public together with their personal profiles and private pictures if that site did not shut its business online as their privacy policy was not acceptable to that hacker. That site had a few hundred users who were Indians. A couple of suicides were reported because of that breach. Scary isn’t that!

                    Precautions: Cases have been reported wherein a trojan (which gives privileges and remote access to the implanter) was activated without the knowledge of the owner of a laptop and their pictures and moments of privacy were clicked and uploaded online on porn sites. A small sized file sent to your mobile phone via an attachment can grant access to the implanter and It may allow them to take photos, videos, record sounds, turn on your location services, receive and make calls, send and receive SMS’s, access your phone book, your email account, pop up obscene images and much more. Thus, the implanter can start taking pictures and videos without your knowledge and there could be a huge privacy breach. Always use a masking tape on the webcam of your laptops to avoid breach of your privacy. As for mobile phones, put a piece of cloth on it when you are not using it. Remember that the mobile phones have cameras on both the side so precaution has to be adopted accordingly.

                    Precaution: Do not indulge in trolling at all. Moreover, when you do not have the facts of the matter, you shouldn’t be paddling false or fake information, be it for some news, views or a person concerned. Remember that whatever appears in the virtual world need not necessarily be true. False and fake information can be made viral easily online, and people like to share such contents without verifying the facts. Trolling may spread hatred, cause to defame someone, make someone an object of shame, make someone to go into self-shame or depression or could end up defaming someone and it could have a punitive effect on that person being trolled if the facts differed from the ones that have been circulated in the trolls. Be discreet while posting or endorsing!
